# hoggormExamples

### Examples for the [hoggorm](https://github.com/olivertomic/hoggorm) and [hoggormplot](https://github.com/olivertomic/hoggormPlot) Python packages.
_This repository is under construction_. It will contain various examples from sensory sciences, chemometrics and other fields where principal component analysis (PCA), principal component regression (PCR) and/or partial least squares regression (PLSR) are natural choices of methods for compression, modelling, prediction or visualization.

### Target audience
The examples are primarily developed along the data science course DAT200 Applied Machine Learning, given the first time in spring 2018 at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, but will be extended further for a more general audience.
